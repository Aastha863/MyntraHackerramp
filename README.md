Feature of gift voucher and Customer badge
❑ This feature will encourage the users buying the products beyond a certain amount in a single transaction by providing 
them gift voucher. Also, for the regular customers there would be subscriptions like gold platinum if done within a 
duration.
❑ In our demo video we have made a simple demonstration of how this feature will work, by making edit text 
implementation of amount and product name. If this feature would be implemented in real Myntra app by fetching the 
APIs, then user will have to do the regular way of transaction in which data being stored in the existing cloud database of 
Myntra app.

Feature of fashion tracker
❑ This feature will require ML model either by implementation of NLP using python or by using Azure AI features. NLP will 
enable user’s regular speech to be implemented and kept as a record. Based on the image pattern, color and dress code 
as the parameter, the model will allow the similar product to be displayed to the user when it is launched or if found 
similar to the existing. The previous products details will be the recorded in the dataset in the form of color code, dress 
code and pattern. The dataset will be extracted from the existing database of the app.
❑ In this demo video, since we don’t have the dataset of the previous user transaction, we have just shown the working 
protype displaying how the user needs to proceed.

handmade/graphic design of their own. Top performers will be decided using the following broad technology: This 
feature will require ML model either by implementation using python or by using Azure AI features. This design will 
require patten extraction features using azure AI. The main purpose is that based on cumulative scores of certain color 
code, dress code as well as design pattern (that was entered by the user in the fashion tracker), the product with the top 
3 most common taste of the above parameters will be declared as a design of the week.
❑ Besides the eligibility to upload design is that user has surely made a transaction on that particular day, which will benefit 
the company. In this demo video, since we don’t have the dataset of the previous user transaction, we have just shown 
the working protype displaying how the user needs to proceed.
